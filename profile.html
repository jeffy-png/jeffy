<p align="center">A perfect and well-written paragraph comprises a key sentence, applicable supporting sentences, and a last (or transition) sentence.<br> T
his structure is fundamental to maintaining your paragraph centred on the main concept and creating a clear and concise photo.<br>
In order to add something interesting, and adding an interesting fact in your content does not necessarily follow the conventional paragraph structure,<br>
 itâ€™s more about scene building and continuing a story.<br> Properly-written paragraphs are a staple of suitable flash fiction and short fiction writing, 
as short testimonies need to target a principal concept.<br>s When your sentences are unified and connected with other sentences, you can write a good paragraph.
